    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>

    </body>
    </html>

# All About Metadata.

   * The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.

   * <meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.

   * Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.

   * Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.

   * There is a method to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page), through the <meta> tag (See "Setting The Viewport" example below).

# HEAD Tag.
  * The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.


# BODY Tag. 
  * The <body> tag defines the document's body.

  * The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

  * ### <span style="color:yellow">Note: There can only be one <body> element in an HTML document.</span>
